# Note: Built in functions intToBits and strsplit are deliberately not used in order to exercise the lower level algorithms
#
# Manual:
# Use form_bin() to convert a vector of numbers into alternating runs of 1s and 0s with the times of repetition taken from the vector.
#       Odd indexed items of the input vector are the times 1's are repeated and vvi.
#       In order to bypass the integer overflow, binary numbers are represented as a string
#       For example: form_bin(c(1,3,2)) returns "100011"
# Use bin2dec() to convert the binary number given by the form_bin()
#       For example bin2dec("100011") returns 35
# Use dec2bin() to convert the decimal number to binary as a string - can be utilized to validate bin2dec(). binary gap uses this function
#       For example dec2bin(35) returns "100011"
# Use binarygap() to find the length of the maximum run of consecutive 0's in the binary representation of the decimal input
#       Note that the output of the binarygap() must be equal to the largest even indexed number in the input vector to form_bin() 
#       For example binarygap(35) returns 3, the largest even indexed number in vector c(1,3,2)
