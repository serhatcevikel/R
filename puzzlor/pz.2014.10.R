# October 2014 - Fighters
# Four different fighters are having an all-out battle to determine who among them is the strongest.  The image above shows those four fighters: Allan, Barry, Charles, and Dan. 

# Each fighter has varying attack and health abilities.  At the start of the battle, they have differing health points: Allan has 10, Barry has 12, Charles has 16, and Dan has 18.  Also, each fighter has differing attack points: Allan has 4, Barry has 3, Charles has 2, and Dan has 1.

# The battle takes place over multiple rounds, each round consisting of a single attack.  In each round, one random attacker and one random defender are chosen.  When the attacker attacks a defender, the defender loses health points in the amount equivalent to the attackerâ€™s attack points.  For example, if Allan is the attacker and Barry is the defender, Barry would lose 4 health points.

# The fighters continue to randomly attack and defend in subsequent rounds until there is only one fighter left, who is then declared the winner.  A fighter is removed from the battle when his life points become zero (or less).

# Question:  Which fighter is most likely to win the battle?

## Solution by Serhat Cevikel
## Using dp, memoized into a matrix, rows of which are indexed through a 4D array (4 players)
## In each recursion, all possible attack permutations are followed with equal probability
## Probabilities are joined into recursion depth through a parameter and multiplication
## Recursion stops when only one player remains with non-zero health


library(gtools) ## for non-repeated permutations
